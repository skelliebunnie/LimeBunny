# Time Tracker + Clock
I got a little tired of all the fancy pants time trackers out there and wanted to build myself something fun. 

This was originally built in 2022 (repo: time-tracker), I've just moved it into a new repo without all the npm/gulp stuff that was breaking things, fixed a few small things that were broken, and moved the play/pause button and timer display onto the same line.
